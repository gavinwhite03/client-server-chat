# client-server-chat

This is a client-server chat application that allows for a server to be created on a specified port, allows multiple clients to connect and chat, as well as serves a webpage that displays very basic statistics such as connected clients, a chat log, and a button to download the chat.

To run the application all you have to do is run the server.jar file and however many client files you would like. Then press the start server button and select a port. Then connect the clients by selecting the port and typing a username, and finally get to chatting.
